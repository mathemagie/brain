I've always loved LinkedIn.

Not just as another social network — but as a genuine force multiplier in the B2B world. Over the years, it's been my secret weapon for connecting with future customers, colleagues, employees, and investors.

But there's always been one consistent challenge: creating engaging content consistently (it's the "consistently" part that's the killer).

So when I heard about a new agent built recently on agent.ai that's completely changed how people think about LinkedIn content, I had to try it out.

Here's how it works in a nutshell:

*   You provide a YouTube video URL (a regular video, podcast, interview, or keynote)
    
*   The agent analyzes it and understands the key points
    
*   It generates 3 different LinkedIn posts (1 humorous, 1 educational, 1 insightful)
    
*   Each post is optimized for LinkedIn's algorithm and engagement
    

In today's newsletter, I'm breaking down some real examples (and showing you where you can try it with your content, for free).

**A Recent Real-World Test**
----------------------------

Earlier this year, I did a podcast with Lenny Rachitsky where we got into HubSpot's _counterintuitive_ growth strategy.

The conversation was packed with insights that could help other founders — everything from product-led growth to building viral loops into B2B products.

But like many busy people, I faced a familiar problem: How do you turn an hour of valuable conversation into bite-sized, engaging social content (without spending another hour doing it)?

That's where this agent came in handy. Here's exactly what I did:

1.  Grabbed the YouTube URL from our conversation.
    
2.  Pasted the transcript into the [YouTube to LinkedIn Post Agent](https://agent.ai/agent/youtube-to-linkedin-agent?utm_source=simple.ai&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=turn-videos-into-linkedin-posts-using-ai-agents) (just copied and pasted — took about 30 seconds)
    
3.  Hit 'Go' and waited about 45 seconds
    

The results surprised me. Not just because of the quality, but because of how well it maintained the core messages while adapting them for different audiences.

**Why This Actually Matters**
-----------------------------

In 2024, LinkedIn isn't just another social platform — it's where the real B2B conversations are happening. But here's the challenge: creating content that cuts through the noise isn't getting any easier.

That's another key point that makes this agent interesting. Instead of just generating generic posts, it creates three distinct flavors:

1.  **Humorous Posts -** These add a light touch to business insights. They're not trying to be TikTok-funny, but they help your ideas land with a smile.
    
2.  **Educational Posts -** These focus on the meaty insights, perfect for when you want to share real learning moments or strategic thinking.
    
3.  **Insightful Posts -** These are designed to start conversations. They take a stance and invite engagement (without being controversial just for clicks).
    

The agent doesn't just rewrite content — it helps you find different angles to share your message. It's like having a content strategist who:

*   Understands LinkedIn's dynamics
    
*   Knows what drives engagement
    
*   Can adapt tone while keeping your voice
    
*   Helps you test different approaches
    

Here's one of my favorite outputs from the "Educational" category:

**Try It Yourself**
-------------------

It costs 1 credit per batch of 3 posts (everyone gets 100 free credits when you sign up).

Some tips for getting the most value:

1.  Start with strong source material (a really good podcast, interview, or keynote)
    
2.  Run multiple variations to get different perspectives
    
3.  Keep the best posts in a content library for future reference
    
4.  Mix different styles throughout the week (humorous posts early week, educational ones later)
    
5.  Always edit the output to match your voice
    

Pro tip: I like to run it on my most successful past posts to get new angles I hadn't considered. Sometimes the AI finds gems in places you wouldn't expect.

_Important note: YouTube to LinkedIn Post Agent uses an AI model that can hallucinate (and also loves bullet points), so make sure you edit to suit and triple-check what you post._

Would love to hear which types of posts work best for you.
